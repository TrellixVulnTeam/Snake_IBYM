# Snake in Python

The Snake game in Python using Python Turtle. I hope to add improvements to this game.

Current features include:
- Snake moves around the map (no warping at the walls)
- Highscore (stored locally in a text file)

Working on:
- Fixing the code so that the game restarts when the user wants to play again
- Improving the UI so that the user can play again. 

Ideas to improve the game
- Maybe adding levels where the snake has to navigate through a small maze?
- Local multiplayer? 
- Customisation of the snake colour?
